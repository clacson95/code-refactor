# code-refactor
Created by Caleb Lacson

## Description  
This is a "Challenge" project for UNH's virtual Coding Bootcamp. Our task is to refactor the Horiseon homepage so as to increase its accessibility and make it more optimized for search engines. This mainly involves improving the existing code by ensuring functionality, consolidating and organizing CSS selectors and properties, and making the stylesehet more readable by incorporating comments.

_The primary areas of code that were refactored are as follows:_
* Fixed a broken link in the navigation bar / header; now it correctly brings you to the corresponding section on the homepage
* Consolidated the CSS selectors and properties by grouping similar HTML elements under one class, and styling them in their groups respectively, rather than having separate selectors and properties for each and every item. This reduced the length of the CSS by approximately 33%.
* Added alt attributes to six (6) image and icon elements
* Ordered the CSS properties alphabetically, beneath their respective selectors
* Developed extensive comments on the stylesheet, including a Table of Contents to give an overview of the CSS, section titles to organize the different selectors and properties, and explanations/descriptions for the various items.
